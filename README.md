# DeLoGics - Decentralized Logistics System

# Project WorkFlow : 

1. Manufacturer registers the product on the mint page of the website by entering the details of the product (Title, Description, Image and Video).
2. The Video is uploaded using the livepeer and the video data is combined with all other product inormation and uploaded on IPFS network.
3. A QR is generated for all the information which is then minted as an nft using the manufaturers wallet.
4. Manufaturer of the project needs to print this QR Code and attach this to the product physically before shipping of the project.
5. Now whenever anyone scans this QR, he/she is redirected to a page where all the real time information about the product can be seen which includes the current owner of the product as well as the images or videos attached along the supply chain while shipping. It can be scanned using any QR code scanner being user-friendly.
6. At every level of the supply chain, whenever the product is transffered from one person to another, current owner needs to scan the QR code and trnsfer the nft to another person. In this way, all the past transactions about the product are recorded along with the nft information making it fully transparent in nature.
7. We can use the "Secure QR", which is a non-copieble QR code i.e it losts it data on reprinting/photocopying so that to avoid frauds like fake products selling, etc.

# What this App uses

### This App has three main parts 
- [`Frontend`](#Frontend)
- [`Backend`](#Backend)
- [`Blockchain`](#Blockchain)


# Frontend

We are using Next.JS for rendering the frontend of the project. The frontend is integrated with both the backend and blockchain.
We are using Redux-thunk along in javascript to make our webapp modular and easy to use.

# Backend

At the `Backend` of this App , A `Nodejs` server is running, which manages all the `requests` and `responses` from the user. 

This App Uses Some Node_Modules in order to work properly which includes:
- `Mongoose`
  - To make requests from backend to MongoDB
- `dotenv`
    - To fetch a .env file from the backend into any file and use it as process.env.example
- `cors`
    - allows a server to indicate any origins other than its own from which a browser should permit loading resources.
- `Express`
  - create a web-server
  - handles request and response


# Blockchain

We chose polygon as the primary chain to deploy the smart contacts. This was due to polygons low gas fees and high supportibility. 
The Contract Address are:
1. nft contract : [0xf3E09b01F9678A1562b184Bb4512E163A387B4Cd](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0xf3E09b01F9678A1562b184Bb4512E163A387B4Cd#code)
1. Products Registry: [0x573e31dF36aCb997aAC134d26Ba69d8C09b6C995](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/address/0x573e31dF36aCb997aAC134d26Ba69d8C09b6C995#code)
